# Solid UI

Reactive primitives and hooks for building declarative, accessible, composable UI components with SolidJS.

## GettingStarted

Solid UI is still actively being built, and many of the component hooks below are not feature complete, all are currently untested, and not considered not ready for production use.

This library was written as part of the SolidJS "SolidHack 2022" community hackathon. These docs reference components as being available as part of the `@solid-ui` NPM package, though this library is not actually hosted yet.

## Demo

To run the Solid UI demo page locally, run these commands:
