Solid UI

Hooks for building declarative, accessible, composable UI components with SolidJS.

Solid UI is still actively being built, and many of the component hooks below are not feature complete, are untested, and not considered not ready for production use.

This library was written as part of the SolidJS "SolidHack 2022" community hackathon. These docs reference components as being available as part of the `@solid-ui` NPM package, though this library is not actually hosted yet.
